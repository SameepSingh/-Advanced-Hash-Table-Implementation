 - Any resource you used for assistance
        -- I used lecture slides and recorded lectures 
 
 - The state of your implementation â€“ whether any functionality is missing or the assignment is complete
        -- According to my knowledge, the assignment is finished.
         Every feature is available, and my testing revealed no memory leaks.
 
 - A summary of your new hashing algorithm, explaining whether and how it meets its must, should and ideally goals
        -- The hashByOddEven method is a straightforward way to create unique codes (hashes) for different sets of characters (like words). It works by looking at each character in a word and doing one of two things: If the character's number value is odd, it adds it to a total; if it's even, it subtracts it. This process is quick and easy, making it great for situations where you need to make these codes fast. However, this method might not be the best at making sure each word gets a completely unique code, especially for words that are similar or have a lot of repeating characters. Also, it's not complex enough for tasks where security is really important, like protecting passwords. So, it's good for simple tasks but not for situations where you need very unique or secure codes.
